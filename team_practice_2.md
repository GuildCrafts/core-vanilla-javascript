# Core Vanilla JavaScript - Team Practice - 2

A marathon of pair exercises in pure javascript that's slightly more challenging than [Team Practice 1](team_practice.md)  
Capped with a final project.
It's a good idea to cut your teeth on the [solo_study](solo_study.md) and [Team Practice 1](team_practice.md) first before attempting these challenges.

### Exercism

Exercism provides a number of practice problems along with unit tests to ensure the accuracy of your answer to the test problems. We will be using exercism challenges for the first three days of this goal.
