# Core Vanilla JavaScript - Team Practice - 2

A marathon of pair exercises in pure javascript that's slightly more challenging than [Team Practice 1](team_practice.md)  
Capped with a final project.
It's a good idea to cut your teeth on the [solo_study](solo_study.md) and [Team Practice 1](team_practice.md) first before attempting these challenges.

### Exercism

Exercism provides a number of practice problems along with unit tests to ensure the accuracy of your answer to the test problems. We will be using exercism challenges during this week.
