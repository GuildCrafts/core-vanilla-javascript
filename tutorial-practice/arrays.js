//TITLE: Is array copied?
// What this code is going to show?

let fruits = ["Apples", "Pear", "Orange"];

// push a new value into the "copy"
let shoppingCart = fruits;
shoppingCart.push("Banana");

// what's in fruits?
alert( fruits.length ); // 4


//TITLE: Array operations.
Let’s try 5 array operations.

Create an array styles with items “Jazz” and “Blues”.
Append “Rock-n-Roll” to the end.
Replace the value in the middle by “Classics”. Your code for finding the middle value should work for any arrays with odd length.
Strip off the first value of the array and show it.
Prepend Rap and Reggie to the array.
The array in the process:

Jazz, Blues
Jazz, Bues, Rock-n-Roll
Jazz, Classics, Rock-n-Roll
Classics, Rock-n-Roll
Rap, Reggie, Classics, Rock-n-Roll


//TITLE: Calling in an array context
What is the result? Why?

let arr = ["a", "b"];

arr.push(function() {
  alert( this );
})

arr[2](); // ?


//TITLE: Sum input numbers
importance: 4solution
Write the function sumInput() that:

Asks the user for values using prompt and stores the values in the array.
Finishes asking when the user enters a non-numeric value, an empty string, or presses “Cancel”.
Calculates and returns the sum of array items.
P.S. A zero 0 is a valid number, please don’t stop the input on zero.



//TITLE: A maximal subarray
importance: 2solution
The input is an array of numbers, e.g. arr = [1, -2, 3, 4, -9, 6].

The task is: find the contiguous subarray of arr with the maximal sum of items.

Write the function getMaxSubSum(arr) that will find return that sum.

For instance:

getMaxSubSum([-1, 2, 3, -9]) = 5 (the sum of highlighted items)
getMaxSubSum([2, -1, 2, 3, -9]) = 6
getMaxSubSum([-1, 2, 3, -9, 11]) = 11
getMaxSubSum([-2, -1, 1, 2]) = 3
getMaxSubSum([100, -9, 2, -3, 5]) = 100
getMaxSubSum([1, 2, 3]) = 6 (take all)
If all items are negative, it means that we take none (the subarray is empty), so the sum is zero:

getMaxSubSum([-1, -2, -3]) = 0
Please try to think of a fast solution: O(n2) or even O(n) if you can.
